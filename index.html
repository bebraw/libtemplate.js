<h1>libtemplate.js - Template for JS libraries designed to work with GitHub Pages and Jekyll</h1>
<p>libtemplate.js makes it easier to start writing JavaScript libraries. It has been
designed to be used with GitHub (and GitHub pages). In addition it uses Grunt
as a build system.

</p>
<p>In order to use it, simply clone this repository and configure _config.yml to
your liking.

</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>Make sure you have <code>npm</code> installed. You are going to need <code>Jekyll</code> as well. In
case you wish to use syntax highlighting, install Pygments. You can get the Node
dependencies simply by using <code>npm install</code> (might need to sudo it).

</p>
<p>In order to generate the initial grunt file, use <code>scripts/generate_grunt.js</code>.
After it has been executed, you should be able to develop the library using
<code>grunt</code>. Examine the generated file for more details.

</p>
<h2>_config.yml Fields</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>project_base</code> refers to the project name without a possible suffix (such as .js)</li>
<li><code>project</code> is meant to contain that</li>
<li><code>description</code> contains a brief (80-100) description of your project. This is
something you would use as your GitHub project description.</li>
<li><code>nick</code> is the nickname you use at GitHub (github.com/\<nick\>)</li>
<li><code>author</code> is your full name as an author. If there are multiple authors, send
me a pull request.</li>
<li><code>license</code> is the license of your project. If there are multiple in use, send
me a pull request.</li>
<li><code>version</code> refers to the version number of your library.</li>
<li><code>jquery</code> refers to version of jQuery to load. If it is empty, it won&#39;t
be loaded at all in the demo.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Example</h2>
<p>This bit is here just to illustrate how Pygments works.

</p>
{% highlight js %}
var a = 4;

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}{% endhighlight %}
<h2>License</h2>
<p>libtemplate.js is available under MIT. See LICENSE for more details.
